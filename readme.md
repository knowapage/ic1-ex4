'Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw
If you've a ready mind
Where those of wit and learning
Will always find their kind'
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

‘You might belong in Hufflepuff
Where they are just and loyal
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil.’
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
