well I think that git is useful. I wish there was a document with the most used commands
I could reference. I think this guide has been helpful overall, but there are some typos in exercise 3. 
It says to type "git add remote..." when it should have been "git remote add..".
I found the videos mostly helpful, I think the visual of showing how multiple branches are made helped.
